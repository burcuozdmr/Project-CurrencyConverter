## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap v5.3
- Vanilla JavaScript - (Promise, fetch)

### What I learned

While developing the Currency Converter application, I implemented and improved the following items:

1. HTML & CSS & Bootstrap Basics:
    - Creating jobs to be done with HTML tags.
    - Implementation of visual style (design) with Bootstrap & CSS.

2. DOM Manipulation (Document Object Model):
    - Select, change and manipulate HTML DOM elements using JavaScript.

3. Event Listeners:
    - Using event listeners to listen and react to user interactions (clicks).
  
4. Functions and Conditional Statements:
    - Creating and using JavaScript functions.
    - Using conditional statements (if, else if, else).

5. ES6 properties:
    - Using Class Structures
    - Promise, fetch

6. Organization:
    - Dividing the project into modules according to their operations (ui.js, currency.js(api operations), project.js etc.)


These items cover the major issues I encountered while developing this basic currency converter app. While developing the application, I had the opportunity to understand, reinforce and apply these topics and helped me improve my JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills more. I made this project to improve my asynchronous programming skills by pulling data from API and using promise and fetch in Javascript.
